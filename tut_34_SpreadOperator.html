    <h2>Spread Operator - feature of ES6</h2>
    <p>for e.g we have an two arrays and we want include both that time we can used spread operator as follows,

    <pre>
        let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];

        let arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
    
        let arr3 = [...arr1, ...arr2];
    
        console.log(arr3);
    </pre>

    If we have add after 5 the and before 6,

    <pre>
        let arr4 = [4, 5, ...arr1, 6]
        console.log(arr4);
        </pre>

    </p>

    <script>
        let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];

        let arr2 = [4, 5, 6];

        let arr3 = [...arr1, ...arr2];

        console.log(arr3);

        let arr4 = [4, 5, ...arr1, 6]

        console.log(arr4);
    </script>
</body>
