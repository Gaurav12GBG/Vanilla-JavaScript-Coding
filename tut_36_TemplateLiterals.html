    <h2>Template Literals - Features from ES6</h2>
    <p>Template Literal does not work in double/single quote, It is work in only backtick(``).</p>
    <pre>
        <b>Basically we are writing the string as follows,</b>
        
        let str = "Hello World";
        console.log(str);

        <b>if we have to write both the words in new line then we are using \n for that as follows,</b>

        let str = "Hello\nWorld";
        console.log(str);

        <b>We are creating the string using backtick and which is also called as template literals.
        We can write whatever format we want as like that,</b>

        <b>e.g 01:</b>

        let str = `Hello
                   World`;

        <b>Output should be,</b>

        Hello
        World

        <b>e.g 02:</b>

        <b>Normally we can used like,</b>
        str = "gaurav";
        console.log("My name is" + str + ".");

        <b>Using template Literals,</b>

        str = "gaurav";
        console.log(`my name is ${str}. Thank you.`);



    </pre>
    <script>
        let str = "Hello World";
        let str = 'Hello World';

        let str = `Hello
                   World`;

                   
        str = "gaurav";
        console.log("My name is" + str + ".");

        
        str = "gaurav";
        console.log(`my name is ${str}. Thank you.`);
